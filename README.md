I saw my [school website](https://www.regentsschoolbali.com/), and it seems it like hasn't been updated in quite a while, so I decided to make my own version of my school website !

## UI/UX Design

A minimalistic website design, that comes along with a couple of components such as glassmorphism, gradient, and 3D image.

## Stack

- [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) - Swiper JS is a versatile JavaScript library for creating touch-enabled sliders and carousels.
